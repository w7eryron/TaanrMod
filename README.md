# TaanrMod
This is where I hope to track my mod and keep a working up-to-date- copy of the source code
...
Many folks on the internet have made it so I can even begin to do this.  Especially Mr. Crayfish a few eyars ago got me started in 1.7.10.  I kept updating thru 1/11 then got busy with other things.  I just updated to 1.14.4 with help from "Harry Talks" and bits of advice from many others online, plus added a 3x3 "mining hammer" something like what is in Tinker's Construct. Only I copied and simplified the code from the "SuperTools" mod. This mod has a OP sword, a simple versoin of the old "Cloud Boots" and a "simple runaway teleport" home.  After I get ths set up I wil put recipes etc into the wiki. - 10/14/2019/rw
